## About Chad Nelson

I am currently learning new analytical tools and practices through the Master of Science in Business Analtyics program at the University of Iowa.

My valuable time is best spent when I am learning something new or engaging with family and friends. I am an avid runner and I like to read when I have time. Right now, I am about halfway finished with Chris Gardner's *The Pursuit of Happyness.* It is one of my favorites because I love a good underdog story. 

This site displays some of my skills, but I am always developing new ones. This site is a work in progress to reflect that.

Please introduce yourself to me! I love meeting new people and learning about their story.
