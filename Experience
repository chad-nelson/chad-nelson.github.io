<h1>Scheels: Marketing Intern</h1>

<p>I worked closely with the marketing manager for the Cedar Falls Scheels store, 
assisting with both social media marketing strategies and store events. I was 
in contact with the corporate office to learn about their overall goals for 
each individual store's social media objectives and used that information to 
create a plan for the Cedar Falls store. My primary goal for the internship was 
to raise the metrics on the Facebook page, the primary social media account. 
I achieved this by implementing new engagement strategies, tailoring content 
for groups of followers, and creating a schedule that aligned with high activity 
times during the day. I also assisted in store event management and helped 
document various metrics at these events.</p>  

<h1>Scheels: Sales Associate</h1>

<p>My objective was to connect with customers on the sales floor and discover their 
needs through qualification questions. Using a wealth of product knowledge, 
I helped customers find products and/or services that fit the needs of themselves 
or their children. This taught me how to become more customer-centric and learn 
customer needs before suggesting any product or service. This position also helped 
develop my interpersonal skills by engaging with customers and coworkers consistently.</p>


<h1>Red Cedar: Digital Marketing Coordinator</h1>

<p>I was responsible for improving awareness and both online and foot traffic to Red Cedar, 
a startup business catalyst for the Northeast Iowa region, through targeted paid and 
organic social media campaigns. Red Cedar is the parent company of Mill Race Coworking, 
a space for entrepreneurs, free lancers, and remote workers. In order to gain 
memberships, I used targeted social media campaigns to build awareness and a CRM to 
connect with potential members based on their occupation and vicinity to Mill Race Coworking.</p>
